Hello, These are my personal projects that I wrote.
Enojy :)

The To-Do list is Python script that I wrote using a library called Tkinter. With only a few hundred lines of code,
was able to create a pretty intuitive and easy-yo-use To-do List/Reminder App. 
The code exists both as a Python script and an executable if you prefer it.
